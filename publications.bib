	ABSTRACT = {A novel control strategy to manage the integration of a wind turbine (WT) and an energy storage unit to an existing stand-alone microgrid servicing an oil and gas (O&G) rig is the topic of this paper. The control strategy includes a primary and a secondary controller that, using the battery in tandem with the WT, does not require any dump load (A). The secondary controller includes an energy management system (EMS) which uses the estimated wind production and other specific local information to size the battery to avoid the curtailment of the WT (B) and simultaneously provide the framework for the economic analysis (C). Points A, B and C are the main novelties introduced with this work. Additionally, a primary controller operates the original microgrid source, a gas turbine (GT), at its maximum efficiency through an active power control strategy to lower fuel consumption, by prioritizing the exploitation of the renewable energy source through the combination EMS and battery sizing. The microgrid is simulated and the combined controller of the battery and GT bench-tested.},

This capstone describes the development of a common streamlined tool and methodology to improve the ability to assess energy resilience for military microgrids using event scenarios including deliberate attacks and natural disasters. The resilience metric used in this report, defined as the expected lifecycle mission impact (ELMI), quantifies microgrid resilience in terms of the microgrid's ability to minimize mission impact against all potential threats to power disruption. The tool considers a realistic set of scenarios that could disrupt power allowing users to compare distributed energy resource (DER) changes against a single microgrid architecture to determine the best balance between cost and resilience. Users can configure the tool to allow for change in microgrid load or updates to equipment costs. A supplemental user's guide provides a thorough walkthrough of the tool, and a supplemental case study demonstrates the tool functionality by analyzing an existing naval installation microgrid.},

	abstract = {Modern warfighters rely heavily on fast, accurate information to conduct all forms of military operations. It is critical that deployed Command and Control centers have reliable power for conduct of military operations and serve as a central node for information relay. For military deployments outside areas with prepared infrastructure for utility power, or in locations with no reliable utility power, stable power supply from microgrids for operations will be required. Such operations range from peacekeeping to humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations. Although such microgrids are generally reliable at providing stable power, their resilience to disruption is poor. Common interruptions include natural disasters like earthquakes, and man-made causes like cyber or physical attacks. Previous research into microgrid resilience evaluation efforts center on theoretical modeling of total electrical microgrid loading, critical electrical load prioritization, assumed capacity of renewable energy sources and their associated energy storage systems, and assumed availability of emergency generators. Experimental data from a scaled microgrid system was collected and assessed against the results from two simulation models by Peterson and Anderson. The results validate the simulation models and highlight some areas for model improvement.},

Six climate change risks are identified for the model analysis including drought, flooding, heat, cold, wildfires, and weather extremes. Each climate change risk is decomposed into ordered effects that inform the impacts that the climate risks may have on microgrids. The climate change risks, ordered effects, and the impacts on microgrids are used to analyze three microgrid models to determine if they adequately incorporate the six climate risks. A model analysis framework is developed to identify gaps in the approach of the models, the input parameters of the models, and the assumptions made in the models. The analysis demonstrates that gaps exist in each model when considering the climate change risks, the ordered effects, and the impacts to the microgrid. These gaps exist in all three models analyzed using the model analysis framework. The identified gaps are used to develop recommendations for ways to improve the incorporation of the climate change risks into microgrid models and the necessary research required to inform that data used in microgrid models.},

Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) microgrid components are a viable cost-effective option to setup stand-alone microgrid systems to support mobile military units and help drive the transition to a more sustainable yet energy-resilient military. Reliability and resilience are key parameters in determining the effectiveness of microgrids in supporting military missions. Although in the past few years many researchers have presented reliability and resilience models of various complexity, experimental measurements and model validation are not available in the literature for mobile COTS microgrids. The goal of this thesis research is to experimentally assess the reliability and resilience of stand-alone, mobile microgrids that can be carried by one or two individuals and can be easily assembled in the field in support of operations in locations where utility power is not available. Utilizing COTS DERs including batteries, PV arrays and power converters, three different standalone microgrid architectures were designed, analyzed, and tested in the laboratory. Reliability block diagrams, and system fault trees were created per MIL-HDBK-338B, to compare the reliability of the three microgrid configurations.},

The Department of the Navy (DoN) defines energy security as consisting of three components, namely reliability, efficiency, and resilience. One of the ways the DoN improves resilience in installation electrical energy systems is by using microgrids. The relationship between microgrid resilience and cost is not well explored in existing research. This thesis develops a seven-step process to estimate the cost of microgrid resilience using design of experiments and regression analysis. The process is designed to be used by installation energy managers when considering the installation or upgrade of a microgrid. The process is demonstrated in a case study using net present value to quantify life cycle cost and expected life cycle mission impact to quantify resilience. The case study analyzes a microgrid representative of a portion of the electrical distribution system at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA, which is made up of multiple diesel generators, a large photovoltaic array, an energy storage system, several loads, and a utility grid connection. The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the process developed in this thesis and the importance of understanding the cost of microgrid resilience to inform decisions about the necessary distributed energy resources that make up a specific microgrid architecture.},

This process applies to any institution with changing operational states whose energy resilience requirements necessitates redundant electrical supply. The methodology may be used by energy managers to account for potential mission scenarios that a base may be part of, followed by assessing the microgrid energy resilience to supply the critical loads for said mission scenarios, especially where external grid power may be unavailable and/or damage to facility microgrid systems may be present. In the event a microgrid design is unable to provide sufficient electrical energy, distributed energy resources (DERs), including energy storage systems and renewable energy resources, may be added to improve energy resilience. A case study is conducted with a fictitious military base, microgrid design, and changing operational demands to demonstrate the application of the methodology.

While complying with {IEEE} standard 1562-2007, the tool allows the user to specify environmental factors of the location and decide upon the total dependence of the system on solar power. Three experiments with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) microgrid validated the design tool and physics-based model.

A resilience definition appropriate for a military context substantiates the selection of three resilience measures for quantifying the change in resilience between a single ESS baseline microgrid architecture, and double and quintuple ESS architectures. Mission impact (MI) from Peterson (2019), islanding time from Van Broekhoven et al. (2014), and average θ glideslope, θg, adapted from Wang and Yoda (2016), are the resilience measures used by a modified resilience analysis process (RAP) adapted from Vugrin et al. (2017). Three equivalent hazard simulation models only differ in the number of ESSs geographically distributed across the microgrid. Macro-enabled MS Excel-based versions of the Monterey Microgrid Simulation Model (Peterson 2019) execute scenario simulations in an hourly timestep over a 24-hour period presenting hazards ranging from component failures to wide-area destructive events (e.g., explosions). The analyses identify greater resilience in microgrids with distributed ESS versus centralized ESS. Furthermore, increased inter-bus connections and energy flow combinations improve resilience in concert with increased ESS distribution.},

In order to perform these missions, specific electrical energy loads must have continuous, uninterrupted power even during terrorist attacks, adversary action, natural disasters, and other threats of specific interest to the military. While many global military bases have established microgrids that can maintain base operations and power critical loads during grid disconnect events where outside power is unavailable, many potential threats can cause microgrids to fail and shed critical loads. Nanogrids are of specific interest because they have the potential to protect individual critical loads in the event of microgrid failure. We present a systems engineering methodology that analyzes potential nanogrid configurations to understand which configurations may improve energy resilience and by how much for critical loads from a national security perspective. This then allows targeted deployment of nanogrids within existing microgrid infrastructure. A case study of a small military base with an existing microgrid is presented to demonstrate the potential of the methodology to help base energy managers understand which options are preferable and justify implementing nanogrids to improve energy resilience.},

Various metrics for assessing microgrid resilience have been described in literature, and multiple tools for simulating microgrid performance have been constructed; however, it is often left to system owners and maintainers to bring these efforts together to identify and realize effective, efficient improvement strategies. Military microgrid stakeholders have expressed a desire for an integrated, unified platform that provides these multiple capabilities in a coordinated fashion. In support of these endeavors, analysis methods developed by NPS and NAVFAC Expeditionary Warfare Center researchers for measuring microgrid resilience have been integrated into an existing web-based microgrid power flow simulation and distributed energy resource rightsizing software tool. This was achieved by the development of additional functions and methods within the existing software platform code base, and expansion of the application programming interface (API). These API additions enabled access to the new calculation and analysis capabilities, as well as increased control over power flow simulation parameters. These analytical and functional contributions were validated through a design of experiments, including comparison to independently generated data, and factorial analysis.},

To best establish energy security for DoD installations, microgrids have been embedded into the energy systems as additional energy sources and controls that support mission readiness. Previous microgrid resilience research has focused on system design and cost efficiency. Considering a different approach, this thesis will pose the question of whether established recovery procedures build resilience within DoD microgrids. Using the Human Performance Impact Recovery Analysis (HPIRA) tool developed as a part of this research, human cognition and human error are implemented into various recovery procedures to determine the most successful recovery times and the man-hours required for a successful recovery. This research demonstrates the impact of human cognition in human actions and allows microgrid stakeholders to understand how human factors impact a microgrid system's recovery.},

	abstract = {Military bases perform important national security missions. In order to perform these missions, specific electrical energy loads must have continuous, uninterrupted power even during terrorist attacks, adversary action, natural disasters, and other threats of specific interest to the military. While many global military bases have established microgrids that can maintain base operations and power critical loads during grid disconnect events where outside power is unavailable, many potential threats can cause microgrids to fail and shed critical loads. Nanogrids are of specific interest because they have the potential to protect individual critical loads in the event of microgrid failure. We present a systems engineering methodology that analyzes potential nanogrid configurations to understand which configurations may improve energy resilience and by how much for critical loads from a national security perspective. This then allows targeted deployment of nanogrids within existing microgrid infrastructures. A case study of a small military base with an existing microgrid is presented to demonstrate the potential of the methodology to help base energy managers understand which options are preferable and justify implementing nanogrids to improve energy resilience.},

	abstract = {With a rising global emphasis on the use of renewable energy and the reduction of fossil fuels, the Department of Defense is incorporating microgrid technology into energy management systems at forward-deployed and domestic installations. Understanding the nature of the connection between a microgrid and the local utility grid is critical in determining if sensitive loads will be adequately supported. {IEEE} Standard 1547-2018 applies to this interconnection and specifies the technical requirements and limitations for normal and abnormal operation and expectations for interrupting events. A commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) microgrid is tested for its compliance to this standard and also for characteristics, such as efficiency, that help define its operational capability. The microgrid can operate in a grid-connected state or an islanded state, disconnected from the utility grid, if the grid is unavailable or if the power quality is unable to support military operations. A microgrid testbed was set up that included the individual COTS components, a centralized control system and several measurement instruments connected that read voltages and currents continuously throughout the experiments. By observing the microgrid functionality, this thesis created an objective characterization template that can be used to assess the capabilities of other COTS microgrids to determine whether they are capable of supporting sensitive loads on forward-deployed or domestic military installations.}

	abstract = {A power electronics-based Energy Management System (EMS) is a key component of a microgrid; it manages loads, controls power flow to improve overall efficiency, and disconnects Distributed Energy Resources (DER) from the main grid in the event of a grid fault. The latter is the focus of the research conducted in this thesis. {IEEE} Standard 1547-2018 provides the requirements relevant to the connection of a microgrid to the main grid. The standard requires that the disconnection control method maintains connection for a specified time, known as voltage ride-through time, during voltage disturbances in the main grid voltage.
			This thesis explores five different methods of EMS control and their respective algorithm for disconnection from the grid. The response times of disconnection from the grid are simulated using a physics-based model validated by experimental measurements on a laboratory prototype. The simulations are compared against the {IEEE} Standard 1547-2018 voltage ride-through times to determine if the different controller dynamic responses meet the requirements. Of the five methods tested, all were in compliance with {IEEE} Standard 1547-2018 grid disconnection times but only the two best performing methods, extended Multiple Second Order Generalized Integrator (MSOGI) and true root mean squared (RMS), were able to comply with the voltage ride-through requirements.}

This thesis develops a physics-based model of a three-phase microgrid set up with three commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) inverters and a battery bank as its energy storage system. Both the model and the laboratory microgrid can be operated in grid-tied or in islanding mode. The microgrid’s voltage waveforms, spectra, total harmonic distortion, and current waveforms are predicted by simulations and measured in the laboratory. {IEEE} Standard 519 and the manufacturer’s performance standards provide the metrics for the power quality analysis. Comparisons of performance of the model to experimental laboratory data determine that the COTS units conform to {IEEE} Standard 519 and are suitable for further studies into microgrid expansion, management, and employment.}

			Combining renewable resources and, specifically, the emerging technology of photovoltaics (PV) with a battery storage system is considered a proven approach to providing energy security and serves as the basis of this research.
			Most available design tools focus on the design of grid-tied or hybrid renewable power systems. The development of a user-friendly design tool for accurately sizing a stand-alone power system to meet the critical load demands of a naval, commercial/industrial, or even a residential facility is presented in this thesis. The tool complies with both {IEEE} Standards 1562 and 1013. In addition to these guidelines, the developed tool considers important factors that both standards should address in their future revisions.
			Several case studies, which were simulated using a Simulink model based on the output of the design program, validate the design software. Finally, we successfully conducted 24-hour laboratory experiments, the results of which confirmed the simulations as well as the accuracy of the sizing methodology; this is a feature that many sizing programs lack.}

	abstract = {Microgrids are used in many applications to power critical loads that have significant consequences if they lose power. Losing power to medical centers, water treatment plants, data centers, national defense installations, airports, and other critical infrastructure can cause loss of money and loss of life. Although such microgrids are generally reliable at providing stable power, their resilience to disruption can be poor. Common interruptions include natural disasters like earthquakes, and man-made causes such as cyber or physical attacks. Previous research into microgrid resilience evaluation efforts centered on theoretical modeling of total electrical microgrid loading, critical electrical load prioritization, assumed capacity of renewable energy sources and their associated energy storage systems, and assumed availability of emergency generators. This research assesses the validity of two microgrid resilience models developed for analyzing islanded microgrids by using experimental data from a scaled microgrid system. A national defense context is provided to motivate the work and align with the intended purpose two microgrid resilience models. The results of this research validate that the simulation models are valid to use in some situations, and highlight some areas for further model improvement.},
